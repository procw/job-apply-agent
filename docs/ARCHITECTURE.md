# Job Apply Agent - System Architecture

For a high-level overview see `README.md`.

This document describes the internal architecture and technical design of Job Apply Agent.

---

## Overview

Job Apply Agent is a modular job discovery and application assistant that automates repetitive job search tasks while keeping a human in control of all final decisions.

The system performs four main tasks:

1. Discover remote job listings from multiple sources
2. Evaluate opportunities against a candidate profile
3. Assist with application form prefilling
4. Require human approval before submission

---

## System Pipeline

```text
python run_pipeline.py full-run
        |
        v
[FETCH]
  -> pull jobs from all enabled sources
  -> normalize to unified schema
  -> deduplicate (URL, external_id, company+title+canonical location, description fingerprint)
  -> insert new jobs into SQLite

        |
        v
[EVALUATE]
  -> compute remote_eligibility (rule-based classifier)
  -> compute rule-based fit_score
  -> assign rule_status (shortlisted / review / rejected)
  -> initialize or preserve final status
  -> select recommended resume

        |
        v
[ANALYZE]
  -> send review-status jobs to Ollama (local or cloud)
  -> structured JSON reasoning (fit score, strengths, gaps)
  -> conservative promotion/demotion
  -> persist LLM fields
```

Result persisted per job:

```text
job metadata
rule_status + fit_score
recommended_resume
LLM reasoning + confidence
final status
```

---

## State Model

Each job passes through three layers:

| Layer | Fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Deterministic | `rule_status`, `fit_score`, `remote_eligibility`, `matched_skills`, `reject_code`, `reject_detail` | Always refreshed on re-evaluate |
| Semantic (LLM) | `llm_fit_score`, `recommendation`, `llm_confidence`, `llm_status`, `fit_explanation`, `llm_strengths`, `skill_gaps` | Set by Ollama; preserved across re-evaluate |
| Decision | `status` | Lifecycle: `new` → `review`/`shortlisted`/`rejected`; `rejected` ↔ `archived`; `expired` is prune-only. Initialized from rule layer; updated by LLM; manually overridable. `evaluate --all-jobs` skips `applied`, `deferred`, `archived`, and `expired`. |

Evaluation policy: `evaluate` always refreshes `rule_status` but only touches final `status` when the job has not already been refined by a successful LLM analysis. This prevents `evaluate --all-jobs` from erasing prior LLM promotions or manual decisions.

---

## Core Components

### Job Sources

Sources are implemented as `BaseConnector` subclasses in `connectors/`.

How to add a board (pagination caps, inspect, register, when to ask): [CONNECTOR_PLAYBOOK.md](CONNECTOR_PLAYBOOK.md).

**Direct ATS connectors:**

| Connector | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DirectATSConnector` | Ashby / Greenhouse / Lever / Workable | Curated `target_companies` list from `profile.yaml`; ATS auto-detected from `careers_url` host |
| `AshbyConnector` | Ashby API | In-window aggregator Ashby URLs not in the Direct ATS list; runs after aggregators |
| `GreenhouseConnector` | Greenhouse API | In-window aggregator Greenhouse URLs not in the Direct ATS list |
| `LeverConnector` | Lever API | In-window aggregator Lever URLs; runs after aggregators |

**Direct ATS host routing:**

```
jobs.ashbyhq.com          → Ashby  (GET /posting-api/job-board/{slug})
boards.greenhouse.io       → Greenhouse  (GET /v1/boards/{slug}/jobs)
job-boards.greenhouse.io   → Greenhouse
jobs.lever.co              → Lever  (GET /v0/postings/{slug}?mode=json)
apply.workable.com         → Workable  (POST /api/v3/accounts/{slug}/jobs)
```

### Remote Eligibility Filter (`utils/remote_filter.py`)

`classify_remote_eligibility(job, profile)` returns `accept`, `review`, or `reject`.

Key rejection patterns (in order):

1. `raw_location` matches known US-only location strings (`usa`, `united states`, `us`) **unless** the profile `accepted_regions` or `work_authorization` includes the US
2. Greenhouse-style prefixes: `us-remote`, `us-east`, `us-west`, etc. (same US-acceptance gate)
3. US substrings in location (`united states`, ` usa`, `(u.s.)`, `(us)`, etc.) unless a broad-region override (`worldwide`, `emea`, etc.) is also present, or the profile accepts US
4. `Remote - [Country]` pattern where the country is not in the user's `accepted_regions`
5. `remote_only`: drop hybrid when the posting requires regular office attendance (`3 days in office`, `hybrid 3/2`, `on-site required`, RTO), regardless of city. Place-tied hybrid / “Remote available” is kept only when it matches `personal.location` (same US state/city, or Remote(US)/Remote(CA) with no other state). Fully remote and worldwide are not place-tied.
6. Description contains hard-reject keywords (`security clearance required`, plus `us only` / `must reside in the us` when the profile does not accept US)
7. Geographic-only locations with no `remote`/`hybrid`/`worldwide`/`global` hint and no accepted-region match

### Seniority Filter (`utils/seniority.py`)

`seniority_exclusion(job, profile)` skips jobs whose detected level is outside `seniority.preferred` + `seniority.acceptable`. Title words first (`intern`, `junior`, `mid`, `senior`, `staff`, `lead`, `principal`, `director`); else a `Level:` line in the description. Unstated seniority is kept. Staff also allows principal. No `seniority` block in the profile means no filter.

### Ingestion Pipeline

`run_pipeline.py` orchestrates:

- fetching from each connector
- normalizing via `connector.normalize(raw_job)`
- skipping jobs that fail `utils/job_inclusion.py` (fully remote vs place-tied hybrid/remote vs office-required; profile seniority; posting language; accepted regions)
- deleting already-stored jobs that fail the same rules (except applied)
- deduplication via `utils/dedup.py` (URL, external_id, normalized company+title+location, long-description fingerprint across URLs)
- upsert into `jobs` table

### Database Layer

- SQLite via SQLAlchemy
- Migrations via Alembic
- Tables: `jobs`, `application_history`, `pipeline_runs`, `interview_prep_sheets`, `company_profiles`

### Job Apply Intelligence Engine (`utils/scoring.py`, `utils/application_filter.py`)

Evaluates job relevance:

- remote eligibility classification
- rule-based `fit_score` from skill overlap, title match, seniority
- blacklisted company filtering
- resume selection (`utils/resume_selector.py`) — matches job keywords against resume tags

### LLM Job Analysis (`utils/llm_analysis.py`)

Uses **Ollama** (`/api/chat`) on the host selected by `config.OLLAMA_MODE` (`local` → `localhost:11434`, `cloud` → `https://ollama.com` with `OLLAMA_API_KEY` in `.env`):

- structured JSON output with fit score, strengths, gaps, recommendation
- conservative status updates: only promotes review→shortlist or review→rejected
- malformed or failed responses do not break the pipeline
- LLM output stored in dedicated fields; never overwrites `rule_status`

### Company research (`utils/company_research.py`)

On-demand from the Job Panel Company tab (not a pipeline stage):

- cache key is a suffix-stripped company name (`Acme Inc` == `Acme`); a second job at the same employer reuses the row
- official site from JD links, Clearbit autocomplete, Wikidata P856, or DuckDuckGo (never Wikipedia)
- homepage/about + Wikidata facts summarized by Ollama into `company_profiles`

### Application Prefill Agent (`utils/form_inspector.py`, `utils/form_filler.py`)

`open-job` opens a shortlisted job in a Playwright browser window and:

1. Detects ATS from the job URL (`utils/ats_detector.py`)
2. For listing-page URLs (Nodesk, RemoteOK, etc.) follows the employer apply link via `extract_apply_url` before scanning the form
3. Scans visible form fields — captures `tag`, `type`, `name`, `id`, `placeholder`, `label` (via `<label for=...>`, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`)
4. Builds DOM context for unlabeled fields by walking up the element tree (handles Ashby EEO comboboxes and non-native dropdowns)
5. Fills text fields by matching labels against `_TEXT_RULES` (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, location, current company, organization, etc.)
6. Smart phone formatting: strips non-digits, applies E.164 or national format as required by the field
7. Age-group dropdowns: selects the matching range from `profile.yaml`
8. Uses the local LLM to generate answers for freeform textarea questions (motivation, cover letters, custom prompts)
9. Gmail IMAP interception: polls inbox for ATS verification emails and auto-fills the security code
10. Handles checkboxes (skills, consent, availability) and radio groups (timezone, career type)
11. Uploads the recommended resume via native file dialog interception with detailed per-attempt logging
12. Bot-protected sites (RemoteOK, WeWorkRemotely, Jobicy) open in the system browser without prefill

### Human Approval Gate

All submissions are manual. The pipeline:

- opens the form in a visible browser window
- prefills what it can
- waits for the user to review, edit, and submit
- prompts to mark the job as `applied` after submission

`application_history` is updated on mark-applied.
