# Job Apply Agent

A local-first AI job search and apply agent that automates the mechanical work between job discovery and application.

## What Job Apply Agent Does

• Aggregates remote jobs from 20 sources
• Deduplicates and filters postings automatically
• Scores semantic fit with an LLM
• Generates answers to application questions
• Automates ATS form filling using Playwright
• Runs fully locally — no data leaves your machine

Job Apply Agent is an AI-assisted job search operator tool.

It runs a continuous pipeline that ingests remote job listings from 17 sources, scores and filters them against a candidate profile, and surfaces the best matches for human review. The operator interacts with the system through a CLI control surface and a natural language assistant backed by live database access — not a chat interface bolted onto a scraper, but a workflow system with stats, triage queues, shortlists, pipeline control, and ATS-aware application automation.

> **Live dataset** — 1,100+ jobs ingested · 17 active sources · 333 pipeline runs · automated deduplication across all sources

## Why This Project Exists

Job searching at scale means manually scanning hundreds of postings across dozens of sites, filtering roles that are geographically restricted or off-target, and tracking applications before they go cold.

Job Apply Agent explores how much of this workflow can be automated through a combination of data pipelines, deterministic evaluation, and local LLM reasoning — while keeping the operator in control of every decision that matters.

The goal is not to automate applying. It is to eliminate the mechanical work that precedes it: discovery, filtering, scoring, and triage. By the time a job reaches the shortlist, it has already passed geographic eligibility checks, rule-based fit scoring, and semantic LLM evaluation. The operator's attention is reserved for jobs that have earned it.

## System Architecture

**Job Apply Agent Architecture**

Job sources feed a local database. An AI evaluation agent applies rule-based filters and LLM reasoning. The operator interacts through a CLI, a natural language assistant, and an ATS automation layer.

<br>

**Job Apply Agent Pipeline**

Each job passes through ingestion, deterministic scoring, LLM semantic evaluation, and a status lifecycle — ending at the operator interface for final review and application.

---

## Key Features

- Multi-source job ingestion from 17 sources (job boards + direct ATS APIs + sitemap crawlers)
- Job deduplication and normalization across all sources
- Remote eligibility classification with geographic pattern detection
- Rule-based fit scoring (skill overlap, seniority, title relevance)
- LLM reasoning via Ollama — local or cloud (`OLLAMA_MODE` in `config.py`), structured outputs, fit explanation, skill gaps
- Persistent job lifecycle tracking (new → review → shortlisted → applied)
- Web UI for job triage, cover letter generation, and pipeline control
- Natural language assistant with live database access and tool calling
- Resume recommendation engine — best resume selected per job from tagged profiles
- ATS detection and Playwright-powered form prefill (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workable, Personio, Comeet, Recruitee, SmartRecruiters)
- LLM-generated answers for freeform application questions (cover letters, motivation fields)
- Cover letter uploaded as a PDF file when the ATS has a file upload field; a dated copy is saved to `cover-letters/` for local review
- Phone country code auto-set via intl-tel-input API or dropdown click (e.g. Tunisia +216)
- react-select EEO dropdowns (gender, race, disability) detected and filled automatically
- Remote eligibility filter rejects APAC-only, LATAM-only, and Southeast Asia-only postings
- Smart phone/age/current-company field fill and Gmail IMAP security-code interception
- "Available from" / "start date" / "notice period" fields auto-filled from profile preferences
- Scheduled automation via Windows Task Scheduler
- Email digest reports after each pipeline run

## Decision Architecture

Each job passes through three independent decision layers. The layered design reflects a deliberate engineering choice: deterministic filters handle objective criteria cheaply and fast, the LLM handles semantic ambiguity, and the human operator handles judgment calls that neither layer should make alone.

```
Layer 1 — Deterministic filters
  remote eligibility    geographic pattern matching against accepted_regions
  role relevance        title keyword matching against target roles
  seniority alignment   persist skip when title/level is outside profile preferred + acceptable
  skill overlap         matched skills and domain keywords from job description
        ↓
Layer 2 — LLM semantic evaluation  (Ollama: local or cloud, from config.OLLAMA_MODE)
  semantic fit          job description evaluated against full candidate profile
  structured output     JSON: fit score, strengths, skill gaps, recommendation
  conservative updates  only promotes or rejects from review; never overwrites manual decisions
        ↓
Layer 3 — Human review
  shortlisted           strong fit, ready to apply
  review                borderline; human decides
  rejected              poor fit or location mismatch
  applied               submitted; tracked in application history
```

This hybrid architecture avoids the two failure modes of pure-ML systems (opaque decisions) and pure rule systems (missed semantic matches).

## Web UI

> **`python run_pipeline.py ui`**

A browser-based triage interface for reviewing and acting on jobs without using the CLI.

**What it does:**

- **Status strip** — live counts across all pipeline stages (New, Review, Shortlisted, Applied, Deferred, Rejected, Expired, Archived). Click any pill to jump to that queue.
- **Job card** — one job at a time. Tabs for Overview (score, highlights, LLM confidence), Company (official site + cached research), Analysis (strengths, gaps, reasoning), Cover Letter (generate via Ollama, copy to clipboard, or download as PDF), Interview Prep, and full Description.
- **Triage buttons** — Reject / Defer / Shortlist with a single click. The card advances automatically to the next job.
- **Open & Apply** — opens the job in a Playwright browser with ATS prefill. After confirming you applied, the card advances to the next shortlisted job.
- **Pipeline panel** — trigger a full pipeline run from the UI and watch fetch → evaluate → analyze progress in real time.

Launch it:

```powershell
python run_pipeline.py ui          # opens http://localhost:7860
python run_pipeline.py ui --port 8080 --no-browser
```

---

## Natural Language Assistant

> **`python run_pipeline.py ask`**

Job Apply Agent includes a local AI assistant that operates on the live system using natural language. It uses tool calling to query the real database and pipeline history — it never guesses or makes up data.

**Example interactions:**

```
You: how many shortlisted jobs do I have?
  → count_jobs_by_status(status="shortlisted")
Assistant: You currently have 3 shortlisted jobs.

You: what should I apply to next?
  → get_top_shortlisted_jobs(limit=5)
Assistant: Your top shortlisted job is Sr. ML Engineer at Anthropic
          (fit score: 87, LLM confidence: 91%). Recommended resume: gpu_systems.

You: what happened in the last pipeline run?
  → get_recent_runs(limit=1)
Assistant: The last run completed at 12:00 today. It fetched 349 jobs,
          33 of which were new. Outcome: success.

You: when does the pipeline run automatically?
  → get_schedule()
Assistant: The pipeline is scheduled at 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM,
          and 8:00 PM daily. Next run: today at 16:00.
```

Available tools:

| Tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `count_jobs_by_status` | "how many shortlisted jobs do I have?" |
| `get_jobs_by_status` | "show me my review jobs" |
| `get_top_jobs` | "what are my best matches?" |
| `get_top_shortlisted_jobs` | "what should I apply to next?" |
| `get_jobs_needing_review` | "what's in my triage queue?" |
| `search_jobs` | "do I have any jobs at Anthropic?" |
| `get_job_detail` | "tell me more about job 42" |
| `get_job_description` | "show me the full description for job 42" |
| `get_pipeline_stats` | "how many jobs are in the system?" |
| `get_recent_runs` | "did the last run succeed?" |
| `get_schedule` | "when does the pipeline run automatically?" |

## Ollama (local or cloud)

Job Apply Agent uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for LLM analysis. Switch hosts in `config.py`:

```python
OLLAMA_MODE = "cloud"          # or "local"
OLLAMA_LOCAL_MODEL = "qwen2.5:3b"
OLLAMA_CLOUD_MODEL = "gpt-oss:20b"
```

`local` calls `http://localhost:11434/api/chat` with no key. `cloud` calls `https://ollama.com/api/chat` with `Authorization: Bearer $OLLAMA_API_KEY`. Put only the key in `.env`. Create one at [ollama.com/settings/keys](https://ollama.com/settings/keys). Cloud mode sends job text and profile snippets to Ollama's servers.

Tested local models:

- `qwen3.5:4b` (good tool calling support)
- `qwen2.5:3b`
- `llama3.1`
- `mistral`

The LLM layer produces structured JSON outputs with defined schemas. Malformed or failed responses do not break the pipeline — the job remains in review.

Jobs older than 3 days are skipped on sources that already completed a fetch. A newly added source uses a 30-day first-ingest window (`MAX_JOB_AGE_DAYS_INITIAL`) until that source has stored jobs. Override with `fetch --initial` or `fetch --age-days N`. The Y Combinator public guest list does not age-filter (already truncated).

Every connector also skips (does not persist) jobs that fail `profile.yaml` filters: `remote_only` on-site roles, postings not written in `languages`, and locations outside `accepted_regions`. Fully remote and worldwide are kept. Hybrid / “Remote available” is kept only when it matches `personal.location` (for a San Francisco home: Remote(CA), Remote(US), or a CA city — not other states). Hybrid with a regular office requirement is always dropped. Fetch and evaluate delete matching rows already in SQLite (applied is kept; deferred / archived / expired ineligible rows are removed).

Adding a board: see [docs/CONNECTOR_PLAYBOOK.md](docs/CONNECTOR_PLAYBOOK.md). Pagination caps apply only when the list is newest-first.

## Pipeline

```
full-run
  │
  ├─ FETCH        Pull from all sources → normalize → deduplicate → store
  │
  ├─ EVALUATE     Rule-based scoring against your profile
  │                 remote eligibility · skill overlap · seniority · title relevance
  │                 → status: shortlisted / review / rejected
  │
  └─ ANALYZE      Local LLM (Ollama) pass on review jobs
                    → promotes to shortlisted or rejects with explanation
```

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Configure your profile

Copy `profile.template.yaml` to `profile.yaml` and fill in your details:

```yaml
skills:          # matched against job titles and descriptions
keywords:        # domain-specific terms (gpu, llm, inference, etc.)
target_roles:    # role titles you're targeting
seniority:       # preferred and acceptable levels
blacklisted_companies:
target_companies:  # curated list with careers_url — ATS auto-detected
preferences:
  remote_only: true
  accepted_regions: [worldwide, emea, europe, canada, ...]
  reject_regions: [us only]
  contractor_ok: true
resumes:         # multiple resumes with tags — best match selected per job
```

### 3. Set up Ollama

**Cloud:** set `OLLAMA_MODE = "cloud"` in `config.py` and `OLLAMA_API_KEY` in `.env`. Create a key at [ollama.com/settings/keys](https://ollama.com/settings/keys). Change `OLLAMA_CLOUD_MODEL` in `config.py` if you want a different cloud model (default `gpt-oss:20b`).

**Local:** install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and pull a model:

```powershell
ollama pull qwen3.5:4b
```

Verify it is running:

```powershell
ollama list          # should show qwen3.5:4b in the list
ollama run qwen3.5:4b "say hello"   # quick smoke test
```

If the model is missing or Ollama isn't responding, common fixes:

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `ollama: command not found` | Restart your terminal after installing Ollama |
| `connection refused` on port 11434 | Run `ollama serve` in a separate terminal, or check the Ollama tray icon |
| `model not found` | Run `ollama pull qwen3.5:4b` again |
| Slow or no response | The model is loading — wait ~30 seconds on first run |
| Want a faster/smaller local model | `ollama pull qwen3.5:4b` and update `OLLAMA_LOCAL_MODEL` in `config.py` |
| Cloud 401 / unreachable | Set `OLLAMA_MODE = "cloud"` in `config.py` and a valid `OLLAMA_API_KEY` in `.env` |

**Once Ollama is set up, you can use the built-in assistant for any further troubleshooting:**

```powershell
python run_pipeline.py ask
```

### 4. (Optional) Configure email reports

```powershell
python run_pipeline.py setup-credentials
```

Credentials are stored in Windows Credential Manager — never written to disk.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST` / `EMAIL_SMTP_PORT` if needed (defaults to Gmail). Full-run fetches the boards checked in the UI settings (`full_run_sources.json`). FlexJobs and JustJoin start unchecked; run `python run_pipeline.py fetch --source flexjobs` or `--source justjoin` for a one-off, or check them in settings. For FlexJobs set `FLEXJOBS_EMAIL` / `FLEXJOBS_PASSWORD`. For Work at a Startup, set `WAAS_EMAIL` / `WAAS_PASSWORD` (included by default; skipped when credentials are missing).

### 5. (Optional) Schedule automated runs

`schedule_run.bat` is pre-configured to run `full-run --email`. Register it with Windows Task Scheduler.

The default schedule runs at 8am, 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm daily.

## Application Assistance

`open-job` opens a job in a Playwright browser window and:

1. Navigates to the application form (follows listing-page → employer apply URL for aggregator sources)
2. Detects the ATS (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, etc.)
3. Prefills fields from your profile (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, current company, location)
4. Fills age-group dropdowns, smart-phone-format fields, EEO/demographic fields (gender, race, disability), and react-select comboboxes automatically
5. Sets the phone country code via the intl-tel-input flag button (e.g. Tunisia +216) on ATS forms that use it (Greenhouse job-boards, Comeet)
6. Fills "available from", "start date", and "notice period" fields from your profile preferences
7. Uses the local LLM to generate answers for freeform questions (motivation, cover letter prompts, custom questions)
8. Uploads the cover letter as a PDF when the ATS has a file upload field; a copy is saved to `cover-letters/cover_letter_<company>__<title>__<date>.pdf` for local review before submitting
9. Intercepts Gmail IMAP to auto-fill security codes when the ATS sends a verification email
10. Attempts to upload the best-matched resume
11. Waits for your review — **you submit manually**
12. Prompts you to mark the job as `applied`; the UI advances automatically to the next shortlisted job

Supported ATS platforms: Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workable, Personio, Comeet, Recruitee, SmartRecruiters. Comeet is detected by URL path pattern (`/o/{slug}/c/`) so custom employer domains (e.g. `careers.tether.io`) are handled automatically.

Bot-protected sites (remoteok.com, weworkremotely.com, jobicy.com) open in your system browser without prefill.

## Design Principles

**Privacy First** — Default LLM processing can run locally via Ollama. Set `OLLAMA_MODE = "cloud"` in `config.py` only when you want analysis to run on ollama.com.

**Human in the Loop** — No application is submitted automatically. Every submission requires your explicit approval.

**Grounded assistant** — The natural language assistant uses tool calling to query real data. It never generates numbers or statuses from inference alone.

**Assistive, not blind** — The pipeline reduces mechanical work (searching, filtering, form filling) while you make the final calls.
